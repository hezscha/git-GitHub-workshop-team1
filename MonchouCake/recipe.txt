Melt the butter a little on very low heat and mix well with the biscuit crumbs. Divide the mixture in the greased springform pan to make a pie-bottom and let stiffen in the fridge.

Beat the cream cheese and sugar creamy.

Beat the cream, vanilla sugar and "Whip it" to stiff peaks.

Fold the cream into the mon-chou mixture and divide the mixture over the bottom.

Cover the cheese cake with the pie filling Let firm in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
