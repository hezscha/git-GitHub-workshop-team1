Separate the egg whites and yolks. Beat the egg whites in a deep bowl until stiff peaks form.

Beat the egg yolks, vanilla sugar and powdered sugar until foamy.

Slowly stir the mascarpone into the foam with a wooden spoon, then the egg yolk-sugar mixture. Add Amaretto to your liking.

We take out a square, deeper bowl. Pour the coffee into a small bowl. If you don't like the strong coffee taste, dilute it with milk. I think the tiramisu will be much tastier this way.

The baby biscuits are suddenly dipped on both sides in the cooled coffee. The bowl in which we put them should stand vertically in front of us, and in the same way we place the baby biscuits close together (approx. 5-6 can fit next to each other). Using this method, lay out the bottom of the bowl, pour half of the cream over it, smooth it out evenly, cover it with another layer of baby sponge cake, pour the remaining cream on top and smooth it out.

Sprinkle cocoa powder on top and it's best to refrigerate overnight.
